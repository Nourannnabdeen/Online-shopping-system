Project Idea

The project aims to create an online shopping website specifically for clothing. The platform will allow users to browse a catalog of clothing items, filter and sort products, manage their shopping carts, and complete purchases through a secure and user-friendly interface. The website will focus on providing a seamless shopping experience with features like dynamic search, multiple payment options, and a responsive design that works across all devices.

This project will cater to modern consumers who prefer the convenience of online shopping while ensuring high performance, security, and usability.
