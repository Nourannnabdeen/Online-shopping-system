Problem Statement

Shopping for clothing online often presents challenges such as:

Inefficient Browsing: Lack of proper filtering and sorting options makes finding desired items difficult.

Poor User Experience: Many platforms lack mobile-friendly and intuitive designs.

Security Concerns: Customers are wary of providing sensitive payment information due to the risk of data breaches.

Limited Payment Options: Not all websites offer diverse payment methods suitable for various user preferences.

This project seeks to address these issues by creating a website that emphasizes functionality, security, and user-centric design
